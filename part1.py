Part 1: Data Processing in Pandas

=== Instructions ===

There are 22 questions in this part.
For each part you will implement a function (q1, q2, etc.)
Each function will take as input a data frame
or a list of data frames and return the answer
to the given question.

To run your code, you can run `python3 part1.py`.
This will run all the questions that you have implemented so far.
It will also save the answers to part1-answers.txt.

=== Dataset ===

In this part, we will use a dataset of world university rankings
called the "QS University Rankings".

The ranking data was taken 2019--2021 from the following website:
https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2021

=== Grading notes ===

- Once you have completed this part, make sure that
  your code runs, that part1-answers.txt is being re-generated
  every time the code is run, and that the answers look
  correct to you.

- Be careful about output types. For example if the question asks
  for a list of DataFrames, don't return a numpy array or a single
  DataFrame. When in doubt, ask on Piazza!

- Make sure that you remove any NotImplementedError exceptions;
  you won't get credit for any part that raises this exception
  (but you will still get credit for future parts that do not raise it
  if they don't depend on the previous parts).

- Make sure that you fill in answers for the parts
  marked "ANSWER ___ BELOW" and that you don't modify
  the lines above and below the answer space.

- Q6 has a few unit tests to help you check your work.
  Make sure that you removed the `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators
  and that all tests pass (show up in green, no red text!)
  when you run `pytest part3.py`.

- For plots: There are no specific requirements on which
  plotting methods you use; if not specified, use whichever
  plot you think might be most appropriate for the data
  at hand.
  Please ensure your plots are labeled and human-readable.
  For example, call .legend() on the plot before saving it!

===== Questions 1-6: Getting Started =====

To begin, let's load the Pandas library.
"""

import pandas as pd

"""
1. Load the dataset into Pandas

Our first step is to load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
We will also change the column names
to lowercase and reorder to get only the columns we are interested in.

Implement the rest of the function load_input()
by filling in the parts marked TODO below.

Return as your answer to q1 the number of dataframes loaded.

    df_2021.columns = df_2019.columns.str.lower()

2. Input validation

Let's do some basic sanity checks on the data for Q1.

Check that all three data frames have the same shape,
and the correct number of rows and columns in the correct order.

As your answer to q2, return True if all validation checks pass,
and False otherwise.

===== Interlude: Checking your output so far =====

Run your code with `python3 part1.py` and open up the file
output/part1-answers.txt to see if the output looks correct so far!

You should check your answers in this file after each part.

You are welcome to also print out stuff to the console

4. Random sampling

Now that we have the input data validated, let's get a feel for
the dataset we are working with by taking a random sample of 5 rows
at a time.

Implement q4() below to sample 5 points from each year's data.

As your answer to this part, return the *university name*
of the 5 samples *for 2021 only* as a list.
(That is: ["University 1", "University 2", "University 3", "University 4", "University 5"])

Code design: You can use a for for loop to iterate over the dataframes.
If df is a DataFrame, df.sample(5) returns a random sample of 5 rows.

Hint:
    to get the university name:
    try .iloc on the sample, then ["university"].

5. Data cleaning

Let's see where we stand in terms of null values.
We can do this in two different ways.

a. Use .info() to see the number of non-null values in each column

non-null values in each column.

===== Questions 18-19: Correlation matrices =====

We're almost done!

Let's look at another useful tool to get an idea about how different variables are corelated to each other. We call it a **correlation matrix**

A correlation matrix provides a correlation coefficient (a number between -1 and 1) that tells how strongly two variables are correlated. Values closer to -1 mean strong negative correlation whereas values closer to 1 mean strong positve correlation. Values closer to 0 show variables having no or little correlation.

20. Exploring data manipulation and falsification

For fun, this part will ask you to come up with a way to alter the
rankings such that your university of choice comes out in 1st place.

The data does not contain UC Davis, so let's pick a different university.
UC Berkeley is a public university nearby and in the same university system,
so let's pick that one.

We will write two functions.
a.
First, write a function that calculates a new column
(that is you should define and insert a new column to the dataframe whose value
depends on the other columns)
and calculates
it in such a way that Berkeley will come out on top in the 2021 rankings.

Note: you can "cheat"; it's OK if your scoring function is picked in some way
that obviously makes Berkeley come on top.
As an extra challenge to make it more interesting, you can try to come up with
a scoring function that is subtle!

b.
